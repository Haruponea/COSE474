Deep learning

## ASSIGNMENT 1
Implement 2-Layer Neural Net with Sofmax Classifier.

Perform the image classification using “MNIST” dataset.

Modify neural_net.py and debug, training and tune your hyperparameters using two_layer_net.ipynb

## ASSIGNMENT 1
Perform the image classification using “CIFAR-10” dataset with CNN (ResNet). Complete the ResNet code(resnet50_skeleton.py) and train the ResNet model.
